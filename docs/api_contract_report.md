# API Contract Alignment Report

This report details the analysis and changes made to align the API contracts between the frontend and backend services.

## 1. `client-gallery-auth` (Supabase Edge Function)

-   **Frontend Call:** This endpoint is **not currently used** by the frontend (`EverMoreFrontEnd_`). The frontend's `clientGalleryService.ts` performs authentication directly against the Supabase database.
-   **Backend Endpoint:** `EverMoreBackEnd_/supabase/functions/client-gallery-auth/index.ts`
-   **Discrepancies Found:**
    1.  **Missing Input Validation:** The backend function did not validate the shape or type of the incoming JSON body, which could lead to runtime errors if the request is malformed.
    2.  **Inconsistent Field Name:** The function was attempting to update a non-existent `last_accessed` field. The correct field in the database schema is `last_accessed_at`.
-   **Changes Applied:**
    1.  **Added Zod Schema:** A minimal `zod` schema was introduced to validate that the request body contains a valid `email` (string, email format) and `code` (string, non-empty). This ensures type safety at the edge.
    2.  **Corrected Field Name:** The `update` operation was corrected to modify the `last_accessed_at` field, aligning it with the database schema (`00001_create_complete_schema.sql`).

## 2. Frontend Type Definitions

-   **Files Analyzed:**
    -   `EverMoreFrontEnd_/src/types/index.ts`
    -   `EverMoreBackEnd_/src/types/index.ts` (as the source of truth from Prompt 1)
-   **Discrepancies Found:**
    1.  **`Gallery` Interface:** The frontend definition of the `Gallery` type was out of sync with the backend's more accurate definition. Fields like `subtitle`, `event_date`, and `cover_image` were incorrectly typed as non-nullable, and `created_at` was missing.
    2.  **`GallerySession` Interface:** The `client_email` field was marked as required, but it is not available in all authentication contexts (e.g., when authenticating via a direct slug link without an email).
-   **Changes Applied:**
    1.  **Aligned `Gallery` Type:** The frontend `Gallery` interface was updated to match the backend. `subtitle`, `event_date`, and `cover_image` are now correctly typed as `string | null`, and the required `created_at` field was added.
    2.  **Made `client_email` Optional:** The `client_email` in the `GallerySession` interface was made optional (`client_email?: string`) to accurately reflect that it may not always be present in the session data.
